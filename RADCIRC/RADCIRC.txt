:"RADCIRC: Get the raidus of a circle

:"Display equation. (H, K) are coordinate points for the center of the circle, (X, Y) are coordinate points for any point on the outside of the circle.
Disp "√((H-X)²+(K-Y)²"

:"Ask for variables to fill-in
Prompt H,K,X,Y

:"Use the distance formula
√((H-X)²+(K-Y)²→R

:"Display the answer
Disp "R=",R
